Found a problem or have a suggestion for how these docs can be improved?
You can report it on the `issues tracker`_ on GitHub.

And... while bug reports are welcome, patches are *even more* welcome. ;-)

The git repository for this site is `hosted on GitHub`_. If you are not already
familiar with git and/or GitHub, read
`our git documentation <{filename}/pages/datamanagement/tools/git.rst>`_ first.

If your proposed fix is limited to content, then you can probably skip setting
up the build system. You can simply make your changes (content is written in
`reStructuredText`_) and submit a `Pull Request`_.

The website is generated by `Pelican`_ and the template is written using
`Jinja2`_. So, if your proposed changes are more widespread or change the
template, you'll need to setup the build environment. Don't worry; it's easy.

* install pelican (``apt-get install pelican`` on Debian; ``pip install --user
  pelican`` on other OSs.)
* install beautifulsoup4 (again: ``apt-get install python-beautifulsoup`` or
  ``pip install --user beautifulsoup4`` respectively), which is required by some
  pelican plugins we use
* run ``make devserver``
* open a browser to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``

And that's it. Any changes you make will automatically trigger a rebuild.
