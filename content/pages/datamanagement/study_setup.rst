Initial study setup
*******************
:order: 410

A study raw dataset contains all raw data and metadata on a study, across
all acquisitions and participants. It is typically created just prior the
first (pilot) acquisition.  Its purpose is to record all data in their raw,
unaltered form, as provided by the respective acquisition machinery.
Moreover, it is used to bind data from multiple acquisition sources (e.g.
MRI, eye tracker, ECG) together, to create a reliable record of what data
were recorded at which point on what hardware. Importantly, this also includes
the logs of any stimulation setup, or behavior responses that are typically
generated by paradigm implementations provided by individual researchers.

*The study raw dataset should capture all information required to reproduce
any subsequently performed data analyses.*


Preparation
-----------
Start off by installing https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/cbbs-imaging-container-import,
which also provides additional tools apart from sheer creation:
``datalad install -s https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/cbbs-imaging-container-import [INSTALL-DIR]``

After successful installation run the following command to retrieve the actual container image:
``datalad get INSTALL-DIR/cbbs-imaging.simg``

Dataset creation
----------------
To create a study dataset you just need to run:
``singularity run INSTALL-DIR/cbbs-imaging.simg create [TARGET-DIR]``.
If you don't provide a target dir, the dataset will be created in the current working directory.
